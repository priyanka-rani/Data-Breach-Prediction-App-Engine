# Data Breach Prediction App Engine
This is part of my M.Sc thesis. Here I deployed the Scikit Learn Model using LinearSVC Classifier and TFIDF+LDA feature vectors to Google App-Engine. I deployed the model and python scripts for using it as a Rest Api. Here, Cyber Security data breach incident will be sent as a post request to this api and response will be the Type of Data breach the model has classified for the post body. I deployed my training model as a Rest Api in order to use it in Web/ Mobile App. Thus, A lot of users will be able to easily detect what type of data breach they encountered by just typing the description of incident in mobile/ web app. I also built an android app for demonstrating the usability of this project.
